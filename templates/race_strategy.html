                <p>Teams switch tires due to tire wear. Tires will degrade over time due to friction from the track. More wear a tire has the less grip it has on the track making it harder to turn at speed and easier to lose control.</p>
                <p>Uneven tire wear can make even easier to lose control of the car</p>
